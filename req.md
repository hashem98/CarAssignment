# Requirements
## The project is based on a small web service which uses the following technologies:
* Java 1.8, or later..
* Spring Boot
* MySQL
* Maven
* Hibernate
* JPA

### You should be aware of the following conventions while you are working on this exercise:
###All new entities should have an ID with type of ``Long`` and a date_created with type of ``ZonedDateTime``.
###The architecture of the Restful service is built with the following components:
###``Request Model``: Objects which are used for outside communication via the API.
###``Controller``: Implements the processing logic of the web service, parsing of parameters and validation of in- and outputs.
###``Service (Interface)``: Implements the business logic and handles the access to the DataAccessObjects.
###``Service Implementation``: Actual implementation of the business logic.
###``DataAccessObjects``: Interface for the database. Inserts, updates, deletes and reads objects from the database.
###``Domain Object [Repo]``: Functional Objects which might be persisted in the database.
###TestDrivenDevelopment is a good choice, but it’s up to you how you are testing your code.
>>You should commit into your local git repository and include the commit history into the
final result.


# Task#1:
Controller for maintaining cars (CRUD).
- Decide on your own how the methods should look like.
- Entity Car: Should have at least the following characteristics: license_plate,
  seat_count, convertible, rating, engine_type (electric, gas, ...)
- Entity Manufacturer: Decide on your own if you will use a new table or just a string
  column in the car table.
- Extend the DriverController to enable drivers to select a car they are driving
  with.
- Extend the DriverController to enable drivers to deselect a car.
- Extend the DriverDo to map the selected car to the driver.


# Task#2
###First come first serve: A car can be selected by exactly one ONLINE Driver. If a second driver tries to select an already used car you should throw a CarAlreadyInUseException.

# Task #3:
###Make use of the filter pattern to implement an endpoint in the DriverController to get a list of drivers with specific characteristics. Reuse the characteristics you implemented in task 1.

# Task #4
###Security: secure the API. It’s up to you how you are going to implement the security (Spring Security or JWT)
